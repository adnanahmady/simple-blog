## Structure

The project structure is as bellow

- .assets `The assets of the readme file are placed here`
- .web `The nginx configurations are placed here`
- .backend `The backend application configurations are placed here`
- [src](./src) `The application itself`
- .gitignore `The assets that should be ignored by git`
- docker-compose.yml `docker compose configuration`
- Makefile `This file is here to help working with the project`

## Requirements

You need `docker` and `docker-compose` in order to run this application.
If you don't have `make` on your operating system for running the application,
you need to read `Makefile` and do as `up` method says, otherwise you just need
to follow [Running](#run-application) section.

### Requirement list

* **docker** you need to have docker installed and running on your system, and
  be able to run the program without using **sudo** command.
* **docker-compose** you need to have docker compose installed on your os.
* **make** in order to use the **make** command you need to have this package
  installed, chances are you have this package already installed on your os,
  specially if you are a linux user, if you don't have it, and you are not willing
  to install it, you can open the **Makefile** located in the projects root, and
  run the commands yourself line by line based on what command you need.
